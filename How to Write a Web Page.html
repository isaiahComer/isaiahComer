        In this article, I wish to instruct you on how to make a shareable web article in a very short amount of time. I could just tell you how to write a Word document or download the Wordpress app, but custom web pages are so much faster and more shareable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you want to be able to code on your mobile device? If so, go ahead and download Git2Go from the App Store on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod.
      </p>
      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/git2go-git-client-you-always/id963577401?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8"><img src="images/AppStoreBadge.svg" style: "height: 10em; width: 55em;"></a>
      <p>
        Our first step is simple: Write down all of the words you want on your web article. I don't care what you use to write, just make sure you write in plain text (no markdown for this template).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, download <a href="#">this template</a> to your computer or phone. It ends in .html, so to make sure you can open and edit it you need to download an editor like iA Writer, Ulysses, or Atom (Git2Go has an editor built in).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step: Create a Github account. Just go to github.com, and sign up. Then create a new repository, and make sure that the repository's name is <em>yourusername</em>.github.io. Insert your Github user name for <em>yourusername</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, you need to copy and paste your article in between the
        `<body>` tags. Follow the instructions to separate the 'body' of your writing into paragraphs.
      <p>
        <!-- To write a paragraph, just put <p> before your paragraph, and then </p> at the end of the paragraph. Sound simple? It is! Start writing/copy & pasting below!ðŸ‘‡ -->
