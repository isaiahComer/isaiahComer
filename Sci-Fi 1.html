    <h1><strong>Science Fiction has gone far enough with the Big Bang Theory</strong></h1>

      <h4>Isaiah Comer</h4>

      <p>Welcome to <a href="theunknownGod.wordpress.com/sciencefiction">Science Fiction</a>.
      This is my first series on The Unknown God.
      I'm starting my Science Fiction series with the Big Bang theory because it is the most widely accepted secular explanation for the cosmos' coming into being.</p>

      <p>Let's get started with the spacetime continuum.</p>

      <h2><strong>Spacetime issues</strong></h2>

        <p>First, let me explain spacetime versus space and/or time.
        Spacetime refers to space, objects, energy, mass, etc. combined with time in a 4D measurement system. Spacetime measurements are measurements that include location, distance, velocity, etc combined with the specific time of measurement. They are therefore more specific than individual space and/or time measurements.</p>

        <p>Got that?</p>

        <p>Good. Let's move on.</p>

          <h3>May the Forces be with you</h3>

            <p>In the beginning it is said that a very small, infinitely dense, infinitely hot point in spacetime was all that was in existence. How did it get there?</p>

              <p>Nobody really claims to know.</p>

              <p>Unless some science buff goes on a rant about singularities (the tiny hot dense dot) and quantum fluctuation mechanisms. Here's how Wikipedia puts it:</p>

              <p><em>In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation (or quantum vacuum fluctuation or vacuum fluctuation) is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space,[1] as explained in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.</em></p>

              <p>I'll sum a quantum fluctuation mechanism up like this:</p>

              <p></em>Under certain conditions in Physics, it is said that (theoretically speaking) a </em></p>

          <h3>If matter, there's still no space-time continuum</h3>

        <h2><strong>Counter-Counter Arguments</strong></h2>

          <h3>The God Particle, the Higgs Boson, proves nothing except that you can get smaller particles by smashing them together at 99% of the speed of light</h3>

          <h3>Chaos theory needs some organized thought</h3>

        <h2><strong>Scientific Laws</strong></h2>

          <h3>There are road signs people</h3>

          <h3>Eternal Information? Is that what religion you believe?</h3>

        <h2><strong>The search for something you can't understand</strong></h2>

          <h3>Steady-State theory makes an unknown force that introduces matter an eternal being</h3>

          <h3>Conformal cyclic cosmology makes the universe an eternal being</h3>

          <h3>mirror universe theory is interesting but still makes the laws of physics a conscious object that obliges itself by becoming existent</h3>

          <h3>4-D Black Hole Mirage theory is not worth the time it takes to write down except to debunk. 4-D BHMT makes the universes, dimensions, etc. infinite, eternal? Matter is not eternal, neither is energy. It will just wither away. That is, if you believe the laws of physics.</h3>

          <h3>Eternal inflation makes...inflation eternal</h3>

        <h2><strong>Science is searching for the One Apostolics have already found.</strong></h2>

        <p>The Word of the Lord endureth forever.
        May I suggest that the One the world has been searching for in space already came to earth in the form of a human child 2000 or so years ago?
        Jesus Christ came to save us and our world got excited for the first 1400 years, and then began to drift away from the knowledge of the Truth.
        Jesus is different than this world. His reach did not cease to exist when He ascended to Heaven. You can still feel Him. He still exists.</p>

        <p>To be honest, the source of the world's suicide problems, drug problems, marital issues, robberies, disease, death itself, is our seperation from God because of sin.
        The more sin and/or separation from the LORD we introduce into our world, the more problems we have.</p>

        <p>The more excuses, the more pain, for all of us.</p>

        <p>Evolution doesn't help.</p>
